# BioEcoThai

## Overview
The **BioEcoThai** Ontology Project is a comprehensive ontology that integrates biodiversity and ecotourism data specific to Thailand. The aim is to support sustainable biodiversity conservation and ecotourism by creating a unified knowledge graph that promotes responsible tourism, facilitates research, and aids conservation efforts. The ontology draws from existing standards such as the DarwinCore terms and Darwin-Semantic Web (DSW) ensuring alignment with global biodiversity initiatives like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

## Goals
- **Promote Sustainable Tourism**: Support responsible tourism by linking biodiversity hotspots with ecotourism opportunities, allowing tourists and researchers to identify areas of high conservation value and cultural importance.
- **Aid Researchers and Policymakers**: Provide a knowledge base that helps researchers and policymakers in making informed decisions about biodiversity conservation.
- **Facilitate Data Integration**: Enable seamless integration of various biodiversity and ecotourism datasets to create a comprehensive understanding of Thailand's natural resources.

## Features
- **Standardized DarwinCore Terms**: The ontology adopts standardized DarwinCore terms, widely recognized and used within the biodiversity community, to promote consistency and facilitate data exchange.
- **Alignment with GBIF**: The ontology structure and terminology are aligned with GBIF to ensure global interoperability and open access to biodiversity data.
- **Ecotourism Data**: Incorporates ecotourism-related concepts to link biodiversity conservation efforts with tourism activities, supporting sustainable development initiatives.
- **High Conservation Value Analysis (HCVA)**: Incorporates High Conservation Value (HCV) analysis, classifying areas based on species richness, endangerment levels, and cultural significance to guide conservation and tourism.

## Structure
The BioEcoThai ontology consists of two main components:
1. **Biodiversity Component**: Includes taxonomic classifications, species attributes, habitats, and conservation statuses. This component is aligned with biodiversity ontologies such as DSW, and utilizes DarwinCore terms and GBIF relations.
2. **Ecotourism Component**: Covers tourism sites, cultural and natural heritage, and their connections to biodiversity. The ontology aims to support responsible tourism by highlighting areas of ecological and cultural importance.

## Use Cases
- **Researchers and Conservationists**: The ontology can be used by researchers to study biodiversity patterns, conservation needs, and species distribution, facilitating data-driven conservation decisions.
- **Ecotourists**: Tourists can use the knowledge graph to find ecotourism sites with high biodiversity and cultural value, encouraging responsible tourism.
- **Policy Makers**: The integrated data can help policymakers identify areas needing protection and create sustainable tourism strategies aligned with biodiversity conservation.

## Getting Started
